# Employee Tracker
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This is a command-line application built from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, the npm package Inquirer, and MySQL.

  Initiate the application through the command line with the command ``node index.js``. You will be taken through a series of prompts that will allow you to view, add, and update various information in the database. When given a list of choices, these choices are pulled from the database to accurately reflect any changes you may have made.
